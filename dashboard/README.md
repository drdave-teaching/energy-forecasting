# Your own forecast dashboard (Lab 6)

A public web page for **your** live energy forecast, built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) and running on
**Google Cloud Run** in your own energy project. It only **reads** the files your energy project already writes every
hour; it never changes anything.

What it shows (Connecticut time):
- your next 24 hours (low, expected and high) next to ISO New England's own forecast
- **My models**: every model you ever shipped (starter, Lab 5, Lab 6C, Lab 6D), when it went live, and how each one
  scored live. Shipping a new model never deletes the old ones: they stay in `energy/models/history/`.
- the Bradley Airport temperature forecast your model is reading
- your past forecasts against the real load, for any lead time from 1 to 24 hours ahead
- your score over the last 1 to 30 days, worked out the same way as the class leaderboard (CRPS, CRPS skill vs same hour
  yesterday, average error, how often the real load landed inside your 80% range)

Everything to change (colors, files, time zone) is in the `SETTINGS` dictionary at the top of [`app.py`](app.py).
Make it yours: add a chart, change the colors, explain your model in a sentence or two. Every change you push to
`dashboard/` redeploys the page by itself.

## Put it on Google Cloud Run (Lab 6, about 5 minutes, no keys)

1. On GitHub, open your `energy-forecasting` fork and click **Sync fork → Update branch** (this brings in
   `dashboard/` and the workflow `Deploy dashboard (Cloud Run)`).
2. **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables → New repository variable**:
   name `DASHBOARD_NICKNAME`, value = your leaderboard nickname (not your name or NetID).
3. **Actions → Deploy dashboard (Cloud Run) → Run workflow**. In about 3 minutes it turns green, and the run's
   **Summary** shows your link, like `https://energy-dashboard-abc123-uc.a.run.app`.
4. Open the link (the first visit after a quiet spell takes about 10 seconds to wake up), then paste it in your Lab 6
   submission.

How it works: GitHub builds a container from [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile), pushes it to Artifact Registry in your
project, and deploys it to Cloud Run as a public page that scales to zero when no one is looking (inside the free
tier). It runs as your project's runtime service account, the same one your Cloud Functions use, so no key is ever
made. If the run says *No Artifact Registry repository found*, run the one command it prints in Cloud Shell, then
run the workflow again.

## Try it in Cloud Shell first (optional, 5 minutes, no keys)

Open Cloud Shell **in your energy project**, then:

```bash
cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-NAME/energy-forecasting.git 2>/dev/null; cd ~/energy-forecasting && git pull
python3 -m venv ~/dash-venv && ~/dash-venv/bin/pip install -q -r dashboard/requirements.txt
ENERGY_BUCKET=YOUR-BUCKET DASHBOARD_NICKNAME="Your nickname" ~/dash-venv/bin/streamlit run dashboard/app.py --server.port 8080
```

Click **Web Preview → Preview on port 8080**. Cloud Shell reads your bucket with your own login, so no key is needed.
Press Ctrl+C to stop it. (Get the newest dashboard any time with **Sync fork → Update branch** on GitHub.)

## Or: Streamlit Community Cloud instead of Cloud Run (optional)

The public app needs its own read-only login to your bucket: a **service account** that can only *view* files in that
one bucket. Its key goes in the app's **Secrets** box on Streamlit, **never in GitHub**.

**a. Make the read-only service account and its key** (Cloud Shell, in your energy project):

```bash
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
BUCKET=YOUR-BUCKET
gcloud iam service-accounts create dashboard-reader --display-name="Streamlit dashboard (read only)"
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs://$BUCKET --member=serviceAccount:dashboard-reader@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com --role=roles/storage.objectViewer
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create ~/dashboard-key.json --iam-account=dashboard-reader@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
python3 ~/energy-forecasting/dashboard/make_secrets.py ~/dashboard-key.json $BUCKET "Your nickname"
```

Copy everything the last command prints (it starts with `nickname =`), then delete the key file:

```bash
rm ~/dashboard-key.json
```

**b. Create the app.** Sign in at [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io) with GitHub → **Create app** →
your `energy-forecasting` fork, branch `main`, main file path `dashboard/app.py`. Open **Advanced settings**, paste the
block into **Secrets**, and click **Deploy**. In a minute or two you have a public link like
`https://your-name-energy.streamlit.app`.

## Rules

- **Never commit a key.** The key belongs only in Streamlit's Secrets box. This repo's `.gitignore` already blocks
  `secrets.toml` and `*-key.json`, but check `git status` before every push. If a key ever lands on GitHub, delete it
  right away: `gcloud iam service-accounts keys list --iam-account=dashboard-reader@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com`,
  then `gcloud iam service-accounts keys delete KEY_ID --iam-account=...`.
- **Nickname only.** Use your leaderboard nickname on the page, not your name or NetID.
- The dashboard's real load is ISO New England's live 5-minute data, so its numbers can differ a little from the class
  leaderboard. The leaderboard is the official score.
- If `keys create` says key creation is disabled for your project, use Cloud Run (above): it needs no key.

## Run it on your laptop instead

Copy your files down (`gcloud storage cp -r gs://YOUR-BUCKET/energy ./mydata/`), run
`streamlit run dashboard/app.py`, and choose **A folder on this computer** → `mydata` in the sidebar.
